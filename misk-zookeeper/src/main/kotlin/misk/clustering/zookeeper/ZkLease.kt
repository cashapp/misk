/**
 * Zookeeper based load balanced lease.
 *
 * <p>Multiple servers use a [misk.clustering.ClusterResourceMapper] to determine which process should
 * own a lease. As long as each process has the same view of the cluster, this mapping will be
 * consistent and processes will not actively compete for the same lease.
 *
 * <p>A lease is acquired by creating an ephemeral node, if it doesn't already exist. Once acquired,
 * it will not be released until the process deletes the node. Each time [checkHeld] is called, a
 * check is made against the current process hash to determine if the lease should still hold the
 * lease, and if not, it will release the lease, allowing the correctly hashed process to acquire
 * the lease subsequently.
 *
 * <p> Once acquired, the lease will generally remain held as long as the lease holder process
 * remains running. However, under certain conditions, such as a network partition or a
 * substantial full JVM pause, the lease may expire if zookeeper doesn't hear from client before
 * the zookeeper session timeout passes. This means that under certain circumstances, the
 * leadership durability is tied to the zookeeper session timeout.
 *
 * <p>
 * Users of this lease framework should avoid creating tasks that have a duration longer than
 * the session timeout or they risk having a split brain running two leader tasks on different hosts
 * simultaneously.
