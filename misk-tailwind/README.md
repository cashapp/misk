# misk-tailwind

The misk-tailwind module provides a type safe interface for frontend UI with [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) and [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html).

For dynamic parts of the provided UI, it uses Hotwire ([Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/), [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)) which offers very lightweight dynamic UI in-browser functionality.
