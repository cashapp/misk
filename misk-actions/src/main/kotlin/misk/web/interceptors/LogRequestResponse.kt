/**
 * Annotation indicating that request and response information should be logged.
 *
 * Rate limiting is used to sample the number of requests logged. The value specified is the
 * log events per sec allotted per action.
 *
 * By default we set rate limiting for successes to 10 log events per second,
 * enough to show things are happening without sending too many logs. By default
 * rate limiting is off for errors, as we would want to surface such logs
 * for investigation.
 *
 * If you would like to turn off rate limiting and emit all logs, set ratePerSecond and/or
 * errorRatePerSecond to 0.
 *
 * Percentage sampling is used to sample request and response bodies, with 0.0 for none and 1.0 for all.
 * Valid values are in the range [0.0, 1.0].
 *
 * If arguments and responses may include sensitive information, it is expected that the toString()
 * methods of these objects will redact it.
