 * A [SpooledProducer] is a producer that writes events to a local spool stored within a

 * local database transactions. Events published to the pool are done within the application's
 * local database transaction; a rollback of the database transaction will also rollback
 * any events published to the spool. Events are asynchronously forwarded from the spool
 * to the event stream, and are done so through a [Producer] transaction.
