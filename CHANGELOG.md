Changelog
==========

Misk releases since 2023-05-27 have been automatically published to Maven on PR merge to master.

The Changelog consequently will not be updated regularly since releases only include the changes of the last PR so the Changelog is now equivalent to the git commit history.

Major and breaking changes will still be documented in the Changelog.
