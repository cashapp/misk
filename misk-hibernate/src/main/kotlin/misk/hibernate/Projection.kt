/**
 * Marker interface for query projections.
 *
 * Projections are used to define the shape of the result set of a query, often as a subset of
 * the properties of the entity or entities being queried.
 *
 * For example, if we have a `DbMovie` entity with a `name`, `release_date`, and other properties
 * we could use a projection to only select the `name` and `release_date` properties:
 *
 * ```
 * data class NameAndReleaseDate(
 *  @Property("name") var name: String,
 *  @Property("release_date") var releaseDate: LocalDate?
 * ) : Projection
 * ```

 * Annotates a parameter of a [Projection] data class to indicate which column (or path of columns)
 * to populate the parameter with.
 *
 * Properties may be created from an [aggregation] function, which will be applied to the column.
 * By default, no aggregation is applied.
