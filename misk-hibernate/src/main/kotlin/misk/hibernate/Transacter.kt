   * A few things that are different with replica reads:
   * * Replica reads are (obviously?) read only.
   * * Consistency is eventual. If your application thread just wrote something in a transaction
   *   you may not see that write with a replica read as the write may not have replicated
   *   to the replica yet.
   * * There may be time jumping. As each query may end up at a separate replica that will likely
   *   be at a separate point in the replica stream. That means each query can jump back or forward
   *   in "time". (There is some support for internally consistent replica reads that peg a single
   *   replica in Vitess but we're not using that. If you need that functionality reach out to
   *   #vitess)
   * * Full scatters are allowed since you can increase the availability of these by adding more
   *   replicas.
   * * If no reader is configured for replica reads when installing the [HibernateModule], this
   *   method will throw an [IllegalStateException].
   * * Note: You can do it another way, where you annotate the [Transacter] with the readerQualifer
   *   defined by [HibernateModule], which will use the read only replica as the datasource.
