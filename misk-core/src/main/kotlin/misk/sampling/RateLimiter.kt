/**
 * A deterministic testable rate limiter that uses two variables:
 *
 * * Permits per second. This is the application's configured rate. We express as a per-second rate
 *   but use it as a time-between-permits. For example, 250 permits per second is a permit every
 *   4 milliseconds. This may be zero, in which case all acquire attempts will return false.
 *
 * * Window size. If the application specified 250 permits per second, that doesn't specify how many
 *   permits can be returned at once. An implementation could strictly return 1 permit every 4
 *   milliseconds, or batches of 1000 permits every 4 seconds. This class hard codes the window size
 *   to 1 second. Small windows shrink batch sizes which is inefficient; large windows grow batch
 *   sizes which is bursty. This class uses 1 second to balance latency and throughput.
 *
 * The implementation tracks a future timestamp that permits are consumed until.
 *
 * This class is similar to Guava's rate limiter. Unlike Guava's rate limiter this class is testable
 * by application code using the rate limiter. It also has very predictable behavior because its
 * internal mechanisms are simpler than Guava's.
