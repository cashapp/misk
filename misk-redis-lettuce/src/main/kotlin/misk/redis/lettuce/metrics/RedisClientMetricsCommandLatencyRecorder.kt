/**
 * A Lettuce command latency recorder that integrates with Misk metrics.
 *
 * This class implements Lettuce's [CommandLatencyRecorder] interface to capture Redis
 * command latency metrics. It records both first response time and total operation time
 * for each Redis command, providing detailed performance monitoring capabilities.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Records command-specific latency metrics
 * - Tracks both first response and total completion times
 * - Includes network address information
 * - Groups metrics by replication group ID
 *
 * Metrics recorded:
 * - **First Response Time**: Time until the first response is received
 * - **Operation Time**: Total time until command completion
