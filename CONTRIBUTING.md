## Building Misk locally

Install and activate hermit: https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/

Use gradle to run all Kotlin tests locally:

```shell
gradle build
```

misk-hibernate tests expect a mysql server running on `localhost:3306` with no password set on
the root user. You might stand up a server with a docker image, e.g.

```shell
docker run -d --rm --name "mysql-57" -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true -e MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE=true mysql:5.7 --sql-mode=""
```

Misk may download these Docker images as part of its tests. Because tests can time out, pre-downloading these can help resolve timeouts.

```
alpine:latest
amazon/dynamodb-local:latest

## Breaking changes

**Note:** Remember to document breaking changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

We integrate [Kotlin Binary Compatibility Validator][2] into our build 
pipeline to automatically detect breaking changes that could affect existing clients.

### [Kotlin Binary Compatibility Validator][2]
This tool checks for changes to the public binary API. The plugin generates a dump of the
current API and compares it to the previous version. If a binary incompatibility is detected, 
the build will fail. 

If the change is intentional, you can run the `:apiDump` task and commit the resulting changes 
to the `.api` files. `.api` files should not have removals and additions in the same change so 
that downstream apps do not immediately run into backwards-compatibility issues.

This runs as part of `gradle check` task, or you can call directly with `gradle apiCheck`.
