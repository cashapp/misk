/**
 * # Misk Services
 *
 * Services in Misk can depend on other services.
 *
 * ### Dependencies
 *
 * Suppose we have a `DatabaseService` and a `MovieService`, with the `MovieService` depending on
 * the `DatabaseService`.
 *
 * ```
 * DatabaseService
 *   depended on by MovieService
 * ```
 *
 * When you install a service via this module, start-up and shut-down of its dependencies are
 * handled automatically, so that a service can only run when the services it depends on are
 * running. In the example above, the `MovieService` doesn't enter the `STARTING` state until the
 * `DatabaseService` has entered the `RUNNING` state. Conversely, the `MovieService` must enter the
 * `TERMINATED` state before the DatabaseService enters the `STOPPING` state.
 *
 * Dependencies can have their own dependencies, so there's an entire graph to manage of what starts
 * and stops when.
 *
 * ### Enhancements
 *
 * Some services exist to enhance the behavior of another service.
 *
 * For example, a `DatabaseService` may manage a generic connection to a MySQL database, and the
 * `SchemaMigrationService` may create tables specific to the application.
 *
 * We treat such enhancements as implementation details of the enhanced service: they depend on the
 * service, but downstream dependencies like the `MovieService` don't need to know that they exist.
 *
 * ```
 * DatabaseService
 *   enhanced by SchemaMigrationService
 *   depended on by MovieService
 * ```
 *
 * In the above service graph we start the `DatabaseService` first, the `SchemaMigrationService`
 * second, and finally the `MovieService`. The `MovieService` doesn't need to express a dependency
 * on the `SchemaMigrationService`, that happens automatically for enhancements.
 *
 * ### What does this look like?
 *
 * Instead of using the regular service multi-bindings you might be used to, in the `configure`
 * block of a Guice [KAbstractModule], you would set up the above relationship as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * override fun configure() {
 *   install(ServiceModule<SchemaMigrationService())
 *   install(ServiceModule<DatabaseService>()
 *       .enhancedBy<SchemaMigrationService>())
 *   install(ServiceModule<MoviesService>()
 *       .dependsOn<DatabaseService>())
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### How does this work?
 *
 * Bindings are hooked up for a [ServiceManager] provider, which decorates the service with its
 * dependencies and enhancements to defer its start up and shut down until its dependent services
 * are ready.
 *
 * This service will stall in the `STARTING` state until all upstream services are `RUNNING`.
 * Symmetrically it stalls in the `STOPPING` state until all dependent services are `TERMINATED`.
