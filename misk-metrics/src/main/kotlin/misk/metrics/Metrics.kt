   * histogram creates and registers a new `Summary` prometheus type.
   *
   * Deprecated: if you really need a summary metric, use [misk.metrics.v2.Metrics.summary] instead.
   *
   * For legacy reasons this function is called histogram(...) but it's not backed by a histogram
   * because of issues with the previous time series backend.
   *
   * If you're using this metric type, you likely want a real Histogram instead of a Summary.
   * To change to histogram type, you need to create a different metric (with another name) as the
   * data structure used by the time series database is incompatible and can break existing dashboards
   * and monitors.
   *
   * See https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Summary.html or
   * https://prometheus.github.io/client_java/io/prometheus/client/Histogram.html for more info.
   *
   * @param name the name of the metric which will be supplied to prometheus.
   *  Must be unique across all metric types.
   * @param help human-readable help text that will be supplied to prometheus.
   * @param labelNames the names (a.k.a. keys) of all the labels that will be used for this metric.
   * @param quantiles is a map of all of the quantiles (a.k.a. percentiles) that will be computed
   *  for the metric. The key of the map is the quantile as a ratio (e.g. 0.99 represents p99) and
   *  the value is the "tolerable error" of the computed quantile.
