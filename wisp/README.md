# WISP

Wisp is a collection of kotlin modules providing various features and utilities, including config, logging, feature
flags and more. Modules are deliberately kept small to allow picking and choose the exact set needed.

## Modules

Modules that are named ending in "Testing" are for test code and should never be used or included in production code.
