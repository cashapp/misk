/**
 * Test services can derive from CachedTestService
 * if they'd like to reuse the same service for the span
 * of a given runtime. This is helpful when you want to avoid
 * incurring the cost of service startup and shutdown with
 * each test run.
 *
 * NOTE: The caching is only useful if the implementing service
 * references a shared instance of their underlying resources.
 * A common way to do this is to leverage a companion object.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @Singleton class TestService : CachedTestService() {
 *   override fun actualStartup() {
 *     service.start()
 *   }
 *
 *   override fun actualShutdown() {
 *     service.stop()
 *   }
 *
 *   companion object {
 *     private val service = Service()
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Sharing the same underlying resources also means that
 * your tests need to be more conscious about accessing
 * resources scoped uniquely to that test run, or else
 * making sure that they cleanup resources before they're run.
 * This is similar to how we work with DBs, where either
 * you run something like truncate tables before your tests,
 * or you ensure that all your test statements are made
 * relative to the scope of your test.
