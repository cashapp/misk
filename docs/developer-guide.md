Developer Guide
===============

## Action
Actions are Misk's unit for an endpoint. Misk lets you make HTTP actions, and gRPC actions via
[Wire](https://github.com/square/wire).

Learn more about [Misk actions](./docs/actions.md)

## Interceptors
Misk uses interceptors (middleware) to observe and potentially transform HTTP messages. The pattern
is borrowed from [OkHttp Interceptors].

Learn more about [Misk interceptors](./docs/interceptors.md)

## Clients
Misk provides configurable HTTP clients built on top of [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
and [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), and gRPC clients built on top of
[Wire](https://github.com/square/wire).

Learn more about how to create, configure and test HTTP clients or gRPC clients within a Misk
application [here](./docs/clients.md).

## Tests
