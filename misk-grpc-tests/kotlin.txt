# This file contains protos that should be compiled by the Kotlin compiler.
#
# Types prefixed with "+[Java]" will be compiled in Java interop mode: all Builder methods will be
# preserved, which will make generated sources compilable against sources generated by the Java
# generator.
#
# Types prefixed with "+[Kotlin]" will be compiled in Kotlin-only mode and may not compile against
# sources generated by the Java generator.
