# This file is a list of proto types that should be included or excluded from code generation.
#
# Lines prefixed with '+' denote types which we want to generate. For example, we include AppService
# so that all of the request and response types for each of its RPCs will be generated.
#
# Lines prefixed with '-' denote types to explicitly exclude from generation that would otherwise
# be generated transitively from an include. For example, we exclude the 'apple_watch_config' field
# in 'GetAppConfigResponse' so that the field, its type, and any transitive types won't be
# generated.

# Options
#-google.protobuf.*
